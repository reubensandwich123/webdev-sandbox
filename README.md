# 🌐 WebDev Sandbox

Welcome to my **WebDev Sandbox** — a personal repository where I collect all my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript mini-projects, experiments, and practice exercises as I learn and grow as a web developer.

## 📌 Purpose

This repo serves as a:
- 🎯 Playground for experimenting with frontend technologies
- 💡 Archive of hands-on practice projects
- 📚 Learning log to track my progress in web development

Whether it's a layout challenge, a DOM manipulation exercise, or just a new CSS trick I'm trying out, it lives here.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure and markup
- **CSS3** – styling and layout (including Flexbox & Grid)
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – interactivity, DOM manipulation, basic logic

> Note: This is a pure frontend learning environment. No frameworks, just the core web stack.
