            <br>
            Spanning six memorable years, my time at Tao Nan School laid the groundwork for both academic discipline and personal growth. I was fortunate to receive the Edusave Award every year—recognition that quietly affirmed my consistency and dedication. Outside the classroom, I proudly represented the school in the National School Games for track and field each year, where I learned the value of perseverance, focus, and healthy competition. One of my most vivid memories remains PSLE results day—a moment of quiet tension and reflection that signaled the close of a meaningful chapter.

            <br>
            My four years at Victoria School were formative in every sense. As the Captain of the cross-country team, I learned to lead by example and to push myself and others through both physical and mental barriers. Academically, I maintained a consistent GPA above 3.75 each year, a reflection of sustained effort and discipline. But more than grades or titles, what I gained most was resilience—the ability to face and overcome challenges that once felt insurmountable. It was here that I made some of my closest friends, and just as importantly, learned to open up, embrace the moment, and have fun along the way.

            <br>
            My time at VJC was intense, rewarding, and transformative. As a member of both the Cross Country and Track & Field teams, I managed the demands of training alongside the academic pressures of JC life. I also took on leadership roles as an Orientation Group Leader and FACE ambassador during Open House—opportunities that challenged me to lead, speak confidently, and connect meaningfully with others. Balancing CCA, studies, and personal setbacks pushed me to develop stronger time management and resilience. I’m proud of the person I became through these experiences, and grateful to have made a difference in helping some of my juniors feel welcomed and integrated into the school community.

            <p style="font-weight: bold">Singapore Civil Defence Force (2024-2026)</p>
            <br>
            I served in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) as a Section Commander in the Special Response Unit (SRU), a role that demanded both physical excellence and tactical leadership. I graduated from the Section Commander Course with distinction, earning a spot in the top four and receiving the Best in Physical Training award. I also achieved Best in Physical during Basic Rescue Training (BRT) and consistently maintained IPPT Gold with scores above 93. My time in NS taught me to lead under pressure, to think clearly when physically and mentally exhausted, and to find solutions even in chaotic, high-stress environments. It was in the field—training and operating with my men—that I truly developed resilience, adaptability, and the kind of leadership that inspires action and trust.

            <p style="font-weight: bold">National University of Singapore (2026-2030)</p>
            <br>
            During my time at the National University of Singapore, I pursued a degree in Biomedical Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in medical device design, human physiology, and applied engineering principles. Living in Temasek Hall taught me the importance of community, discipline, and balance, while my involvement in Cross Country and NUS Mountaineering pushed my physical and mental limits beyond the classroom. As an active member of the Biomedical Engineering Club, I collaborated with peers on real-world health tech challenges. One of my most impactful contributions was leading a project to develop a compact, AI-assisted triage patch designed for first responders—a wearable capable of rapidly assessing vital signs and injury severity in mass casualty scenarios. This experience not only honed my problem-solving skills, but also deepened my commitment to using technology to serve those on the front lines.
