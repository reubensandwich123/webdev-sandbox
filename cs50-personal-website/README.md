### What I learned
- Learned how to use Bootstrap components to create a responsive and consistent layout across different devices.

- Applied CSS Flexbox and Grid systems to align and organize content in both rows and columns effectively.

- Used JavaScript to dynamically update the DOM in response to user interactions like button clicks.

- Implemented event listeners to trigger changes in text, styling, and image display when different buttons are clicked.

- Maintained state using variables to control which content is shown at any given time.

- Styled components with custom CSS and added hover effects for a better user experience.

- Managed relative paths to load images and media correctly across multiple HTML pages.

- Structured the project by separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into individual files for modularity and clarity.
